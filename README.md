React + Redux + ES6 Boilerplate
====
I don't want to setup a new application from scratch everytime I start a new project using React + Redux + ES6 + Hot Reloading + Webpack + ESLINT so I decided to create this boilerplate project.

This project was heavily inspired in [hjs-webpack](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/hjs-webpack) that makes webpack configuration nice and easy.

## Requirements
1. Node
2. You'll need to have `npm > 3.x.x` installed on your system.

## Usage

For example, you can import redux anywhere you want just by doing:
```js
import redux from 'redux'
```

For development:

1. `git clone https://github.com/alejandronanez/redux-react-boilerplate ./your-project-folder`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` -> Starts a server on `http://localhost:3000/`

Build your project:

1. `npm run build`
