React + Redux + ES6 Boilerplate
====
I don't want to setup a new application from scratch everytime I start a new project using React + Redux + ES6 + Hot Reloading + Webpack + ESLINT so I decided to create this boilerplate project.

This project was heavily inspired in (hjs-webpack)[https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/hjs-webpack].

## Usage
For development:

1. `git clone https://github.com/alejandronanez/redux-react-boilerplate ./your-project-folder`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` -> Starts a server on `http://localhost:3000/`

Build your project:

1. `npm run build`
